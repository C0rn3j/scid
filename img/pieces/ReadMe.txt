This folder contains the set of pieces that can be used in Scid.

Each subfolder identifies a set and contains the images used for the various dimensions of the board.
A .gif file for each dimension is necessary.
If a .png file is also provided (and the installed tcl version supports png images: version 8.5 with optional tkimg package or version 8.6) it will be used instead of the gif image.
The authors of the images are specified in a copyright file within each folder.

Each picture contains all the pieces (pawn, knight, bishop, rook, queen, king) for both color and must comply with the specified size.
For example:
myownpieceset_40.gif must be an image with length 480 (40 x 12) and 40 pixels height.
myownpieceset_70.gif must be an image with length 840 (70 x 12) and 70 pixels height.
etc..

You can easily add your own set simply adding a directory with your favourite images: the new set will be available the next time Scid starts.
