Changelog for unofficial Scid 3.5a
Scid 3.5a is based on Scid 3.4 maintained by Shane Hudson

All code for 3.5a so far by Michal Rudolf <mrudolf@uw.edu.pl>
unless the entry says something else.

Features:
* Adds Ctrl+W combination to close current database.

* Adds ~ (unclear) and ~= (with compensation) as shortcuts for commenting 
current game (press <tilde><enter> or <tilde><equal><enter>). Also, PGN NAG 
"with compensation" ($44) is now displayed as "~=" instead of "$44" (if 
someone has suggestion for better symbol, please let me know). 

* Now PGN Window should use proper charset for current language (important for 
non-Western languages, such as Polish or Czech).

* Adds "Open database" command to Database Switcher.

* Add option in PGN window to display main line (i. e. moves of the game, not 
the variations) in bold font. Any ideas to improve (further?) readability 
of the PGN text are welcomed.

* Adds Shift+MouseWheel combination for the main board: it goes 5 moves 
forward/back.

* Use pieces symbols from current language.

Changes:
* Changes version name to Scid+ 3.5a (so that it is visible that this is new 
version. 

* Display rather nothing than 0 in Rating column of crosstable.

* display Elo rating change for current tournament (assuming K=10)

* rating displayed even for 1 rated game

* don't use unfinished game for calculation (they were treated as lost for 
both players so far)

* Removes { } from comments for Color mode in PGN Window

* Player name got the focus for Player browser

* Site got the focus for Tournament browser

* Some changes to the English help file. (Martin S.)

Bugg fixes:
* Fixes nasty bug with displaying best games in Tree window: NAGs (!, !!, ?? 
etc.) were shown at incorrect places (they were shown for the next move, 
instead of current one)

* PGN header configuration is now remembered correctly (i. e. if short, 
3-lines header was selected, it would be restored on the next Scid's start)

* Adds {} around many expressions in 'expr' and 'if' functions. According to 
Tcl documentation it is safer and faster (it was already suggested on 
scid-users@ list long time ago)

* Now NAGs entered/cleared in the Comment window are immediately shown in the 
main window (fixes bug reported on scid-users list)

* Fixes bug which caused comment to be duplicated when adding variation to a 
commented move (also reported before)

* Those patches should improve Scid's behaviour for non-Western languages. Now 
current language's encoding is set as default and databases comments are 
stored in real UTF-8, not in the broken version of it. 

* fixes Elo calculation bug: rating difference cannot be larger that 350, 
larger rating are truncated for calculation purpose

* fixes minor bug for 100% result

* fixes no-Elo player bug: some unrated games were used for calculation

* Should fix most of the problems with Phalanx (now Scid uses analysis command 
that Phalanx has, although doesn't say so).

* Comments out single command that was causing bug when pressing "Training" 
button in Analysis window. 

Known issues:
* Adds ~ (unclear) and ~= (with compensation) as shortcuts for commenting 
current game (press <tilde><enter> or <tilde><equal><enter>).
[Keyboard layout problems.]

* Language support:
There is still problem with running Scid in non-Western languages with Tcl 
8.4.x, because Scid refuses to start due to conversion problem. I tried 
different solutions for it, but neither is perfect.

* Sometimes last move is ignored when browsing a game very quickly; first move 
on entering "Check variation" mode seems to be ignored), but it works.
