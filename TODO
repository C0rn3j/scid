GAME EDITOR
* automatically delete empty comments
* adding move at the end of variation deletes previous comment
* add ~ and ~= to comment editor
* fix: with comment editor active browsing the game 'modifies' it
* fix: adding comment before first move of the variation doesn't 
  scroll PGN window
* better PGN display (figurine font?)
* better editor (it would be best to merge Comment Editor and PGN Window)
* automatically replace conflicting NAGs (f. e. ??/?/?!/? or =/+=/=+)
* warn user when replacing large portions of game comments
* when merging game, merge into variations too
* when merging game, try to ignore move sequences (merge at last 
matching position)
* allow merging two commentaries of the same games (f. e. we got
  (Annotator: Fritz    15. Bg5 ( {better } 15. Ng3) )
   Annotator: Crafty   15. Bg5 ( {with equality} )
   =>
   15. Bg5 ( {Fritz: better } 15. Bg3 )
           ( {Crafty: with equality} )
* add "Save/Replace" option for "Current game has changed" dialog

BOARD
* when browsing game: show message box with main (game) move and 
  variations (as in ChessBase)
* swap board depending on player name (you can define your name and all your
  games will be shown from your perspective)
* update board after every move when Right/Left arrow is pressed (possible
  by adding "update idletasks", but it causes flickers
* GoTo game ignores changes to cuurent game
* ignore Right arrow at the end of the game/variation
* (?) make Home/End go to the end of the variation, not the game?
