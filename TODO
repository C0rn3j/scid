A essayer  :pgn.tcl, l256: n'envoyer que les coups (pas les commentaires en vert -> showboard : ne prendre que les caractÃ¨res non verts)

 ===========================================================

- Right click in PGN window does not always display the right position. Happens because of some comments parsing. Bug exists in original Scid 3.6.1
  -> see sc_pos_pgnBoard in tkscid.cpp (remove comments with sc_game_strip)

 ===========================================================

- add vars from analysis engine when the engine is locked

- Migrate optrainer to Mask

- Option to set engines as 1st and 2nd default engines

- Add a Game training ala Fritz' "Friend mode"

- scidt from maintenance menu

- compile openseal for PocketPC

- Add endgame tables support to PPC

- use tablelist package to revamp Game List window

- port FICS canvas to PPC

- FICS : user defined commands at login

- Separate remove comments / remove NAGs (often I would like to remove
only comments, leaving NAGs)

- Single command to remove comments+NAGs+variations+nonstandard tags (useful
when exporting/copying a game with copyrighted annotations)

- Remove game(s) from clipboard
You can remove game(s) from filter, but Clipboard can only be emptied, you
cannot remove some games. Such a feature is useful when you choose some games
for exporting. -> workaround open game list and RMB for removing games from filter before export

- Keyboard shortcuts for 'Discard'  / 'Go Back' in 'Leave game' dialog

- Start game analysis at the end of the game to fill hash tables

- vars add at the end of a game

- Engines tournament (with specific opening line ?)

- export opening report in PGN (and check HTML conversion) : see proc mergeGame l.119 of end.tcl [sc_report opening best a 50]

- book generation from Scid (re-use of Polyglot code)

   Annotator: Crafty   15. Bg5 ( {with equality} )
   =>
   15. Bg5 ( {Fritz: better } 15. Bg3 )
           ( {Crafty: with equality} )

BOARD
* fea: ignore Right arrow at the end of the game/variation
* fea: update board after every move when Right/Left arrow is pressed
