 ===========================================================

- Notify games with annotations in "Best game", show annotator there.
  Consider sort order: e.g. annotated games on top?

- Merge games including NAGs / variants(?)

- Allow to save the list from the tournament finder. Drop restriction
  to 1000 games for this save.

- In spell checker: give more information in case of ambigious names.
  E.g. first line of SSP-file or %Bio lines will help to sort things
  out.

- Spell check, ambigious names: In case of multiple hits, drop limit
  of the first 10, more should be allowed here.

- Add more complete header to browse game.

- improve commentary arrows: thicker, starting form the real middle of
  the field, ending at the middle of the field, get a thin black
  frame.

- Add a Game training ala Fritz' "Friend mode"

- use tablelist package to revamp Game List window

- Start game analysis at the end of the game to fill hash tables

- Engines tournament (with specific opening line ?)

- book generation from Scid (re-use of Polyglot code)

- FIDE changed the number of rating list per year. Alas, Scid seems to use 4 lists per year layout even for new games.

--- Joram op den Kelder -----------------------------------------------

- When merging game A into game B, A is added as a new variation. Is this a conscious choice? It seems illogical to me. For example: if game B is analysis of an opening variation, it's not possible to add a newly played game to a non-main variation of the analysis. Workaround: manually change the appropriate variation into the main line, merge games, and change back to the original main line.

- Is is possible to include variations when merging? Practical examples: adding an analysed game (with relevant notes) to a game which consists of opening analysis; adding an pgn-update of an existing opening book to the original analysis; merge multiple analysis of the same position (different pupils of the same teacher, shared analysis among friends).

- Is it possible to merge multiple games at ones?
