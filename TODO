- Go to any move. Go one move back. Add a comment, let's say "Good move". 
Make a move, choose "Add New Variation". The comment will be repeated. -> KNOWN BUG, let's say it is a feature

Possible improvements (perhaps not bugs, but awkward)

- It is possible to add NAG before the first move of the game/variation. For variations, it is not even visible.

- PGN window with short header ON. If strip first moves -> the game is empty (bug exists in Scid 3.6.1)

- Right click in PGN window does not always display the right position. Happens because of some comments parsing. Bug exists in original Scid 3.6.1

 ===========================================================

- Option to set engines as 1st and 2nd default engines

- Set a Tree mask to filter displayed moves, color for moves / positions, flags, etc

- Add a Game training ala Fritz' "Friend mode"

- scidt from maintenance menu

- compile openseal for PocketPC

- Add endgame tables support to PPC

- use tablelist package to revamp Game List window

- port FICS canvas to PPC

- FICS : user defined commands at login

- Separate remove comments / remove NAGs (often I would like to remove
only comments, leaving NAGs)

- Single command to remove comments+NAGs+variations+nonstandard tags (useful
when exporting/copying a game with copyrighted annotations)

- Remove game(s) from clipboard
You can remove game(s) from filter, but Clipboard can only be emptied, you
cannot remove some games. Such a feature is useful when you choose some games
for exporting. -> workaround open game list and RMB for removing games from filter before export

- Allow setting 'Low CPU priority' for engines by default
This is the case under Windows. Under Linux, a solution is to start engines with prio=5 by default. 
Another solution is to make an option or remember latest setting -> DONE

- Keyboard shortcuts for 'Discard'  / 'Go Back' in 'Leave game' dialog

---------------------------------------------------
                   PRIORITY 1
---------------------------------------------------
- Use the connection icon set for DGT also when Citrine is connected
---------------------------------------------------
                   PRIORITY 2
---------------------------------------------------
- Start game analysis at the end of the game to fill hash tables
- Display several score graphs if there are multiple evaluations (sc_game_scores l.7339 of tkscid.cpp)
- remove Ctrl-R and if gn = 0 -> add game , otherwise replace
- vars add at the end of a game
- Engines tournament (with specific opening line ?)
- 6 men EGTB support (http://kd.lab.nig.ac.jp/chess/tablebases-online/)
- export opening report in PGN (and check HTML conversion) : see proc mergeGame l.119 of end.tcl [sc_report opening best a 50]
---------------------------------------------------
                   PRIORITY 3
---------------------------------------------------
- The ability to delete a whole tree from "tree window". To be able to trim undesired moves and games from the database easily.
- book generation from Scid (re-use of Polyglot code)
- The idea of markers on the board to show opening stats is good, but there are still questions that arise :
	- how to show both frequency and score ?
	- is is relevant to show arrows when the number of games played is low (for example under 5) ?
	An idea could be to use colors for scores :
	- green : score > 55%
	- light green : score between 50 and 55 %
	- light red : score between 45 and 50 %
	- red : score < 45%
---------------------------------------------------
                   PRIORITY 9
---------------------------------------------------
- mini board false (seems due to comments in PGN window)
- The ability to save a (layout). So SCID can access often used windows with a menu choice. For example: One (layout) might be "board window" + "tree window" + "engine analysis", and a second (layout) might be any other combination of windows I might choose.

Categories:
bug: bug to be fixed
cmd: command to be added
opt: option to be added
fea: internal feature to be added
ide: larger feature, idea or new concept
usa: improve usability, clean interface

GAME EDITOR
* cmd: [~] and [~=] buttons in Comment editor
* cmd: "Save/Replace" option for "Current game has changed" dialog
* fea: automatically delete empty comments
* fea: automatically replace conflicting NAGs (f. e. ??/?/?!/? or =/+=/=+)
* fea: merge game ignoring move sequences (use last matching position)
* fea: merge game into variations too
* fea: properly detect that game was modified
* fea: warn user when replacing large portions of game comments
* ide: any NAG in Comment editor (combo box?)
* ide: better editor (best: merge Comment Editor and PGN Window?)
* ide: allow merging two commentaries of the same games (f. e. we got
  (Annotator: Fritz    15. Bg5 ( {better } 15. Ng3) )
   Annotator: Crafty   15. Bg5 ( {with equality} )
   =>
   15. Bg5 ( {Fritz: better } 15. Bg3 )
           ( {Crafty: with equality} )

BOARD
* fea: ignore Right arrow at the end of the game/variation
* fea: update board after every move when Right/Left arrow is pressed 
(possible
  by adding "update idletasks", but it causes flickers
* ide: when brownsing, show box with main move and variations (as in CB)

* ide: make Home/End go to the end of the variation, not the game?
* ide: use fancy graphics for pieces and background

SEARCH MATERIAL
* fea: find symmetrical patterns (pawns a,b,c = f,g,h)
* fea: search by white/black/all piece count
* fea: find certain moves, specially captures (f. e. BxPe6 or RxNc3)
* fea: 'any white(black) piece' in patterns
* usa: Material Search window (use tabs)

DATABASE

* ide: datasets (you define current filter to be current database subset)
