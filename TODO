- Go to any move. Go one move back. Add a comment, let's say "Good move". 
Make a move, choose "Add New Variation". The comment will be repeated. -> KNOWN BUG, let's say it is a feature

- Open any game via Finder. In Recent files, paths contain /./ making it 
possible to have the same file listed twice. -> SEEMS OK

Possible improvements (perhaps not bugs, but awkward)
- Empty variations are not deleted when last move is deleted)

- It is possible to add NAG before the first move of the game/variation. For variations, it is not even visible.

- PGN window with short header ON. If strip first moves -> the game is empty (bug exists in Scid 3.6.1)

- Right click in PGN window does not always display the right position. Happens because of some comments parsing. Bug exists in original Scid 3.6.1

- when clicking quickly on engine's "add move" it will try to add several moves for the same color, hence an error comment in PGN.  Bug exists in original Scid 3.6.1

- sc_game push generates a new game that sc_game pop does not delete. This is used by trial mode and lead to memory leak.

INTERNATIONALIZATION
* bug: correct charset support in Tcl 8.3.x and Tcl 8.4.x -> TO BE FIXED BY USERS OF CHARSETS
* bug: convert from current encoding to UT8 on import -> NO, NEED TO SWITCH TO MSGCAT
* bug: convert from UTF8 to current encoding on export

GAME EDITOR
* bug: with comment editor active browsing the game 'modifies' it -> try to detect that comment editor did not change, so no need to flag game as dirty.

 ===========================================================

- Add endgame tables support to PPC

- use tablelist package to revamp Game List window

- port FICS canvas to PPC

- FICS : user commands at login

- FICS : 
	* implement timeseal (post a message to MAd -> full box, tried Hawk) Hi, I would like to use timesealing with the port of Scid I made on Pocket PC (I added FICS and Novag Citrine support). Could you give me pointers or a binary that could act as a proxy (ARM processor)?

- Separate remove comments / remove NAGs (often I would like to remove
only comments, leaving NAGs)

- Single command to remove comments+NAGs+variations+nonstandard tags (useful
when exporting/copying a game with copyrighted annotations)

- Remove game(s) from clipboard
You can remove game(s) from filter, but Clipboard can only be emptied, you
cannot remove some games. Such a feature is useful when you choose some games
for exporting. -> workaround open game list and RMB for removing games from filter before export

- Allow setting 'Low CPU priority' for engines by default
This is the case under Windows. Under Linux, a solution is to start engines with prio=5 by default. 
Another solution is to make an option or remember latest setting -> DONE

- Keyboard shortcuts for 'Discard'  / 'Go Back' in 'Leave game' dialog

- Remove icons for adding coordindates/move indicator from standard toolbar.
These are hardly used (user prefers one version or another, he doesn't change
it). Some commonly used functions will be better.

---------------------------------------------------
                   PRIORITY 1
---------------------------------------------------
- Use the connection icon set for DGT also when Citrine is connected
---------------------------------------------------
                   PRIORITY 2
---------------------------------------------------
- Start game analysis at the end of the game to fill hash tables
- Display several score graphs if there are multiple evaluations (sc_game_scores l.7339 of tkscid.cpp)
- remove Ctrl-R and if gn = 0 -> add game , otherwise replace
- vars add at the end of a game
- Engines tournament (with specific opening line ?)
- 6 men EGTB support (http://kd.lab.nig.ac.jp/chess/tablebases-online/)
- export opening report in PGN (and check HTML conversion) : see proc mergeGame l.119 of end.tcl [sc_report opening best a 50]
---------------------------------------------------
                   PRIORITY 3
---------------------------------------------------
- The ability to delete a whole tree from "tree window". To be able to trim undesired moves and games from the database easily.
- book generation from Scid (re-use of Polyglot code)
- The idea of markers on the board to show opening stats is good, but there are still questions that arise :
	- how to show both frequency and score ?
	- is is relevant to show arrows when the number of games played is low (for example under 5) ?
	An idea could be to use colors for scores :
	- green : score > 55%
	- light green : score between 50 and 55 %
	- light red : score between 45 and 50 %
	- red : score < 45%
---------------------------------------------------
                   PRIORITY 9
---------------------------------------------------
- mini board false (seems due to comments in PGN window)
- The ability to save a (layout). So SCID can access often used windows with a menu choice. For example: One (layout) might be "board window" + "tree window" + "engine analysis", and a second (layout) might be any other combination of windows I might choose.
