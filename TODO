Just experienced the following while adding custom flags:

- Define a new custom flag: if the text is to long (?) Scid silently
dies. The input box allowed me to add a 9 chars tag, but it seems the
length is limited. Using a shorter text works.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, flag's description is limited to 8 chars. I fixed this overflow bug.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- After adding a custom flag text the internal representations are not
updated, ie. the "Mark this game as" submenue of game info still shows
"Custom n".

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fixed.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- How would I add a (custom) flag to all games in filter? I'm sure I had
this option before via context menu of the games list.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No, I don't think you had this option via context menu of the game list. 
To add a flag to a bunch of games is done via the maintenance window.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Currently, it seems that adding a flag to a game is only available via
game info context menu. This would cause some trouble in case you hide
that area.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can also use the maintenance window.

By the way, Alexander, did you finish the correspondence stuff you wanted to do ? If so, I can release Scid 4.0.

 ===========================================================

- Notify games with annotations in "Best game", show annotator there.
  Consider sort order: e.g. annotated games on top?

- Merge games including NAGs / variants(?)

- Allow to save the list from the tournament finder. Drop restriction
  to 1000 games for this save.

- In spell checker: give more information in case of ambigious names.
  E.g. first line of SSP-file or %Bio lines will help to sort things
  out.

- Spell check, ambigious names: In case of multiple hits, drop limit
  of the first 10, more should be allowed here.

- Add more complete header to browse game.

- improve commentary arrows: thicker, starting form the real middle of
  the field, ending at the middle of the field, get a thin black
  frame.

- Add a Game training ala Fritz' "Friend mode"

- use tablelist package to revamp Game List window

- Start game analysis at the end of the game to fill hash tables

- Engines tournament (with specific opening line ?)

- book generation from Scid (re-use of Polyglot code)
