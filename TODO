    Hi,

    Another attempt from my side to do something about Scid's crazy appetite
    for memory. After playing a few hours with a tree and a UCI engine
    running, the OS kicks Scid out; it uses more than 3 GB of RAM by that time.

    This one is about memory consumption in the Game class (we have to start
    somewhere).

    With my memory tool I notice that with every move I make on the board,
    AllocateMoreMoves() (game.cpp:515) is called to eat another chunk of
    8KB. From the code it transpires that such chunk should be for 100
    moves, so this is strange...

    All these calls come via the Game::Init() function - others seem to take
    freely available chunks into account indeed.

    I have no idea what structure the code above the game class is supposed
    to have, but
    1) it must be strange to construct a new game object (the constructor in
    game.h seems to be the only user of Init(), is this done indeed?) for
    each move played on the board
    2) if this is necessary for tcl/tk to work, I see no reason not to
    destroy the previous game object (note that the destructor ~Game() is
    never invoked - not even upon program termination).

    Would be nice to hear your opinion.
    Joost.

 ===========================================================

- Notify games with annotations in "Best game", show annotator there.
  Consider sort order: e.g. annotated games on top?

- Merge games including NAGs / variants(?)

- Allow to save the list from the tournament finder. Drop restriction
  to 1000 games for this save.

- In spell checker: give more information in case of ambigious names.
  E.g. first line of SSP-file or %Bio lines will help to sort things
  out.

- Spell check, ambigious names: In case of multiple hits, drop limit
  of the first 10, more should be allowed here.

- Add more complete header to browse game.

- improve commentary arrows: thicker, starting form the real middle of
  the field, ending at the middle of the field, get a thin black
  frame.

- Add a Game training ala Fritz' "Friend mode"

- use tablelist package to revamp Game List window

- Start game analysis at the end of the game to fill hash tables

- Engines tournament (with specific opening line ?)

- book generation from Scid (re-use of Polyglot code)
