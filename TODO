GAME EDITOR
* automatically delete empty comments
* add ~ and ~= to comment editor
* fix: with comment editor active browsing the game 'modifies' it
* fix: adding comment before first move of the variation doesn't 
  scroll PGN window
* better PGN display (figurine font?)
* better editor (it would be best to merge Comment Editor and PGN Window)
* automatically replace conflicting NAGs (f. e. ??/?/?!/? or =/+=/=+)

BOARD
* when browsing game: show message box with main (game) move and 
  variations (as in ChessBase)
* swap board depending on player name (you can define your name and all your
  games will be shown from your perspective)
* update board after every move when Right/Left arrow is pressed (possible
  by adding "update idletasks", but it causes flickers
* ignore Right arrow at the end of the game/variation
* (?) make Home/End go to the end of the variation, not the game?
