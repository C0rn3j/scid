Bug l 251 / 254 de optable en mode docked : le destroy flingue la fenêtre

  if { ! [winfo exists $w.text.bd]} {
  ::board::new $w.text.bd 30
}
makeReportWin winfo exists .oprepWin 1
makeReportWin winfo exists .oprepWin après destroy 1
alloc: invalid block: 0x121c6380: 48 12
Abandon

When I save the layout with only the board on it and Auto load first layout is selected, the next time Scid starts the board doesn&#39;t show up, only the &quot;board&quot; tab can be seen. After resizing the window the board appears. It happens only when there is no other tab open besides Board when the layout was saved.
