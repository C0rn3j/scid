Sorry, but it is not fixed (actually, it has become worse).

At the variation point, the analyis goes one move back (instead of one move forward?).

See attached screen shot.

Start analysis - without book - of 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.a4 (3.h4 h6 4.g3) 3... a6 4.b3

At the point where the two arrows for 3.a4 and 3.h4 are displayed, analysis now resumes at 2... Nf6 (and keeps on resuming there, see the screen shot).

Thanks,
Joost.

 ===========================================================

- Notify games with annotations in "Best game", show annotator there.
  Consider sort order: e.g. annotated games on top?

- Merge games including NAGs / variants(?)

- Allow to save the list from the tournament finder. Drop restriction
  to 1000 games for this save.

- In spell checker: give more information in case of ambigious names.
  E.g. first line of SSP-file or %Bio lines will help to sort things
  out.

- Spell check, ambigious names: In case of multiple hits, drop limit
  of the first 10, more should be allowed here.

- Add more complete header to browse game.

- improve commentary arrows: thicker, starting form the real middle of
  the field, ending at the middle of the field, get a thin black
  frame.

- Add a Game training ala Fritz' "Friend mode"

- use tablelist package to revamp Game List window

- Start game analysis at the end of the game to fill hash tables

- Engines tournament (with specific opening line ?)

- book generation from Scid (re-use of Polyglot code)
